# Shared workflow memory protocol

Structured memory is the durable handoff between isolated roles. Use it as the
single source of truth for workflow state.

Never copy conversation history into memory. Store only information another
isolated role needs to continue correctly.

Memory ownership:

- `requirement` (R):
  User-visible behavior or need that must be satisfied.
  Explorer establishes the wording. Reviewer decides satisfaction.

- `acceptance_criteria` (A):
  Observable conditions proving requirements are fulfilled.
  Explorer defines them. Reviewer decides satisfaction.

- `scope`:
  Explicit boundaries of the request.
  Explorer establishes included and excluded work.

- `constraint`:
  Mandatory restrictions, invariants, or limitations.
  Explorer establishes them. All roles must respect them.

- `fact`:
  Verified evidence from the repository or environment.
  Explorer discovers them. Other roles may add only newly verified facts.

- `todo`:
  Executable implementation plan.
  Planner owns creation. Implementer owns completion.

- `decision`:
  A consequential choice that affects future work.
  Planner owns architectural/design decisions. Do not record ordinary coding
  choices.

- `change` (CH):
  Actual implementation changes with affected paths and behavior.
  Implementer owns creation and updates.

- `verification` (V):
  Reproducible evidence from testing or inspection.
  Tester owns creation and invalidation.

- `issue` (I):
  A routed problem requiring correction:
  defect, requirement gap, plan gap, or verification gap.
  Create only when action is required.

- `working_state`:
  Temporary reasoning, hypotheses, and intermediate exploration.
  Resolve, promote, or discard before handoff.

- `checkpoint`:
  Controller routing state only.

Always preserve relationships:
R -> A -> TODO -> CH -> V

If evidence invalidates previous state:
- update the owned memory if your role has authority;
- otherwise create an issue and route to the responsible phase.

Do not create unnecessary records. Small tasks should remain small.
